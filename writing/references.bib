 abstract = {A simple method of obtaining asymptotic expansions for the densities of sufficient estimators is described. It is an extension of the one developed by Barndorff-Nielsen & Cox (1979) for exponential families. A series expansion in powers of n-1 is derived of which the first term has an error of order n-1 which can effectively be reduced to n-3/2 by renormalization. The results obtained are similar to those given by Daniels's (1954) saddlepoint method but the derivations are simpler. A brief treatment of approximations to conditional densities is given. Theorems are proved which extend the validity of the multivariate Edgeworth expansion to parametric families of densities of statistics which need not be standardized sums of independent and identically distributed vectors. These extensions permit the treatment of problems arising in time series analysis. The technique is used in another paper (Durbin, 1980) to obtain approximations to the densities of partial serial correlation coefficients.},

            SymPy is an open source computer algebra system written in pure Python. It is built with a focus on extensibility and ease of use, through both interactive and programmatic applications. These characteristics have led SymPy to become a popular symbolic library for the scientific Python ecosystem. This paper presents the architecture of SymPy, a description of its features, and a discussion of select submodules. The supplementary material provide additional examples and further outline details of the architecture and features of SymPy.

It is shown that if the diagonal entries are specified and principal minors, composed of specified entries, are positive, then, if the undirected graph of the specified entries is chordal, a positive definite completion necessarily exists. Furthermore, if this graph is not chordal, then examples exist without positive definite completions. In case a positive definite completion exists, there is a unique matrix, in the class of all positive definite completions, whose determinant is maximal, and this matrix is the unique one whose inverse has zeros in those positions corresponding to unspecified entries in the original partial Hermitian matrix. Additional observations regarding positive definite completions are made.}
