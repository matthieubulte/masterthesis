\section{Higher-order statistics} \label{sec-ho-stats}

This chapter introduces the necessary theoretical tools to construct and study higher-order statistics. In Section \note{ref}, we first give a review of the role and properties of the characteristic function to study continuous multivariate distributions. In Section \note{ref}, we show how the results presented before can used to construct the Edgeworth series approximation to the density of a standardized sum. We then study the convergence of this approximation scheme and illustrate theoretical results by applying it to simple distributions. In Section \note{ref}, we present the Saddlepoint approximation. We compare it to the Edgeworth approximation and demonstrate how it can be used to approximate the density of the maximum likelihood estimator in an exponential family, linking Saddlepoint approximations to the $p^*$ approximation. Finally, we conclude this chapter with a numerical comparison of the $p^*$ approximation and the standard Normal approximation to the density of the maximum likelihood estimator.
