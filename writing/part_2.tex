\section{Gaussian Graphical Models}

In this chapter, we study the problems related to submodel selection in Gaussian graphical models. In Section \note{ref}, we start with a review of graphical models and Gaussian graphical models. We then study the existence and computation of the maximum likelihood estimator of the precision matrix in a Gaussian graphical model under different assumptions on the graph. In Section \note{ref}, we apply the $p^*$ approximation from Section \note{ref} to compute an accurate approximation for submodel testing. The test resulting from this approximation is then numerically evaluated against the likelihood ratio test in different dimensionality setting.
