\section*{Acknowledgements}

First and foremost, I would like to thank Professor Mathias Drton for his support over the last years, and for giving me the opportunity to write my thesis under his supervision. I learned a lot from our discussions and he was always available, kind and patient when I needed him. Professor Drton has also been a great mentor, and provided me insightful guidance even outside the scope of my thesis.

Further, I am thankful for my great friends who have made my time in Germany so special. I have enjoyed our enlightening discussions, their advice in difficult decisions, but also simply the fun that we had together. Thank you in particular to C\'eline, Johannes and Martin for your support and friendship in the last months.

Last but not least, I would like to thank my family for their love, their encouragements and everything I had the chance to experience with them. They have shaped me into the person I am today, and I am deeply grateful for having them.
