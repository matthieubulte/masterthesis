\begin{proof}
    Without loss of generality, we assume that $X_i$ has a mean equal to 0 and a covariance matrix equal to the identity, see Remark \ref{rem-centering}. Let $\xi$ be the Fourier transform of $e_k(\cdot; \kappa)$, then by Corollay \ref{corr-fourier-inv}, we can bound the the absolute difference between $f_Y$ and $e_k(\cdot; \kappa)$ as
    \begin{equation*}
        |f_Y(y) - e_k(y; \kappa)| \leq (2\pi)^{-p}\intRp{t}{|\zeta(tn^{-1/2})^n - \xi(t)|},
    \end{equation*}
    where $\zeta(tn^{-1/2})^n$ is the characteristic function of $Y$. Since both $\zeta$ and $\xi$ are $L^1(\Rp)$, the integral is well defined and provides a valid upper bound. We proceed by splitting the range of integration in two parts: one parts in which $t$ is small such that Theorem \ref{thm-edge-inv-tech} can be used, and the rest of the integral will be handled separately.

    By construction of the Edgeworth series, the Fourier transform of $e_k(\cdot; \kappa)$ corresponds to the function given in (\ref{eq-edgeworth-fourier}) of Theorem \ref{thm-edge-inv-tech}. Hence, for any $\varepsilon$, there is a $\delta$ such that (\ref{eq-edge-bound}) holds and we can bound the \textit{small $t$} part of the integral as
    \begin{align*}
        \int_{B_2(\delta\sqrt{n})} &|\zeta(tn^{-1/2})^n - \xi(t)| \d t\\
        &\leq (2\pi)^{-p}\int_{B_2(\delta\sqrt{n})}\expf{-\frac{1}{4}\norm{t}_2^2}\left[ \frac{\epsilon\norm{t}_2^k}{n^{k/2-1}} + \frac{C_0^{k-1}\norm{t}_2^{3(k-1)}}{(k-1)!n^{k/2-1/2}} \right] \d t \\
        &\leq \frac{\epsilon C_1}{n^{k/2-1}}\expec{T}{\norm{T}^k_2} + \frac{C_2^{k-1}}{(k-1)!n^{k/2-1/2}}\expec{T}{\norm{T}_2^{3(k-1)}}
        = o(n^{(1-k)/2}),
    \end{align*}
    in which $T \sim N(0, 2\mathbb{1}_p)$ and $C_0, C_1, C_2 \in \R$ are constants that do not depend on $n$. 

    For the remaining part of the integral, where $\norm{t}_2 \geq \delta \sqrt{n}$, we bound the integral by the triangle inequality and consider each term separately,
    \begin{align*}
        \int_{\Rp \setminus B_2(\delta\sqrt{n})} &|\zeta(tn^{-1/2})^n - \xi(t)| \d t \\
        &\leq \int_{\Rp \setminus B_2(\delta\sqrt{n})} |\xi(t)| \d t + \int_{\Rp \setminus B_2(\delta\sqrt{n})} |\zeta(tn^{-1/2})^n| \d t\\
        &= I_1 + I_2.
    \end{align*}
    By construction of $\xi$, the integral $I_1$ has an exponential decay, faster than the $o(n^{(1 - k)/2})$ we are trying to show. As for the integral $I_2$, using that $|\zeta(t)| < 1$ for $t \neq 0$ and $|\zeta(t)| \rightarrow 0$ for $n \rightarrow \infty$, there exists a $a \in (0, 1)$ such that for $n$ large enough if $\norm{t}_2 \geq \delta\sqrt{n}$ then $|\zeta(tn^{-1/2})| \leq a$. Furthermore, by assumption of the existence of $f_Y$ and Lemma \ref{lem-char-integrable-convolution}, there exists a $q > 1$ such that $\zeta^n \in L^q(\Rp)$. Thus,
    \begin{equation*}
        I_2
        \leq a^{n-q} \int_{\Rp \setminus B_2(\delta\sqrt{n})} |\zeta(tn^{-1/2})|^q \d t 
        \leq a^{n-q}\sqrt{n}\intRp{t}{|\zeta(t)|^q} 
        = o(\sqrt{n}a^n) = o(n^{(1-k)/2}),
    \end{equation*}
    which concludes the proof.
